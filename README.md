# Portfolio

## MY TASK
    My task was to create a portfolio page from scratch using core skills I've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.

## User Story

    AS AN employer
    I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
    SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position


## MOCK UP

The following image shows the web    application's appearance and functionality:
